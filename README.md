### Hi there 👋

I'm a 21 year old full-stack engineer & AI developer

## ⚡️ Current

Currently working on building [wanim](https://wanim.vercel.app/)

## 💎 Experience

I like to say that I am a full-stack developer, but I have most experience with frontend development, primarily [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). However I also do backend development, primarily using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [Python](https://www.python.org/).

I'm spending four years studying Computer Engineering at [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Techonology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/), focusing on low-level programming using [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/) and [Java](https://java.com/) & specializing on Robotics.
